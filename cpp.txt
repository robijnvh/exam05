Notes for CPP:

CONST:
	variables:
		const int* a = 5 -> cannot modify the contents(5) of this pointer(a).
		int const* a = 5 -> same as above.
		- So the const is before the actual pointer sign(*).
		int* const a = 5 -> cannot reassign pointer(a) but can modify value(5).
		- So the const is after the actual pointer sign(*).
		const int* const a = 5 -> cannot reassign pointer(a) and cannot modify value(5).
	
	classes and functions:
		int getVar(void) const -> means the class function cannot modify any of the class (read_only).
		void setVar(int x) -> you cannot declare this class function as const because you will not be able to change value.
		const int* const getVar(void) const -> class function returns pointer that cannot be modified and its contents cannot be
			be modified either and the function itself will not modify any of the class.
